# repair-design-project

Hello!
I would like to introduce my layout html/scss work called "repair design project"
In the repository you will find .scss and .html files (and .css file too, just in case)
To compile SASS into CSS you need to install an extension to your Visual Studio Code called Life Sass Compiler and follow guideline
Please, feel free to leave comments as it is my second layout only (Grazie!)
